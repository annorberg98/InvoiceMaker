# InvoiceMaker 
InvoiceMaker is a program created as an assignment for a C#-course at MalmÃ¶ University. 

At the moment, it simply loads data from a text-file and displays it as an Invoice. 
When invoice-data is loaded into the program, you can add discounts to the Invoice.

Run the application. To load a file, click `File > Open` and select the file. Select the DEMO.txt-file in the project files to see an example of how a data-file should look.

To add a discount, Click `Discount > Set Discount`. Then enter a number as discount, click `Ok` and watch the price become reduced.

Support for JSON-files will be implemented in the future.

## Creating you own data file

```
